# Identify the System Verification

## 📌 Project Description
"Identify the System Verification" is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to maintain, update, and verify details of a digital system on the blockchain. It ensures transparency and immutability in recording verification states.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To create a decentralized and tamper-proof mechanism for tracking system verification status, ownership, and metadata—supporting secure auditing and transparency in digital ecosystems.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Owner-controlled Management**: Only the contract owner can update system data.
- **Verification Toggling**: Easily toggle whether the system is verified or unverified.
- **Immutable Audit Log**: Events emit changes for transparent on-chain tracking.
- **Public Read Access**: Anyone can view system status and metadata.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Role-based access control (multi-admin).
- Integration with decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
- Adding version history for every system update.
- On-chain timestamping verification reports.
- Oracle integration for automated off-chain verification feeds.
